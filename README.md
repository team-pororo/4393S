# 4393S (Team Pororo) v5 Full Codebase

This is our full codebase for our VEX robot "Xx_Dale_xX". Well commented, intelligently organized, and concise design...* 
what's not to love? You can thank our designated code monkey @wesleycha for all this code. 

(*Well, it *used* to be all those things. Some late nights of rushed features have thrown some of that out the window...)
