Slightly less garbage then the cortex code. Became unmaintainable after states, so we completely rewrote it. If we could find no value in this code, there's almost zero chance you will, but I hereby release it into the public domain anyway. Have fun trying to understand how all of the convoluted state machine logic works, because I sure as hell can't and I'm the one who wrote this dang thing.
